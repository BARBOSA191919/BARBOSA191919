## Hi there 👋, my name is Santiago Barbosa


Soy Desarrollador de Software junior Front-end

I am a software development student with a strong desire to gain experience in a work environment that complements my studies. I specialize in front-end development and have basic knowledge of Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I am interested in working in a team, learning, and sharing my knowledge. Although I am competitive, I am passionate about helping to solve problems, which fuels my curiosity to find innovative solutions. My work experience includes roles as an event advisor and a math problem transcriber on Blogger, but now I seek to redirect my career towards software development.

As a software development technologist, I aspire to be part of a solid company where I can demonstrate my competencies and apply the knowledge acquired during my university studies. I am a responsible and disciplined person, always focused on achieving the highest quality and productivity in the tasks assigned. I possess analytical thinking and an excellent capacity for learning, and I value teamwork to achieve the company's goals.
